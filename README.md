### What I learned

This little project helped me start to put some of the knowledge I have acquired into practice. I learned how to create classes and how to use them. Also, how to create containers and use created classes in CSS. It helped developed a much better sense as how to use margins, paddings and how to structure them.

### Continued development

I not only want but definitely need to continue to develop my skills both in HTML and CSS. I need to continue to practice how to structure my code and how to style it appropriately in CSS. In specific, margins, paddings and alignments are things I definitely need to continue to use so I can get more comfortable with them.
